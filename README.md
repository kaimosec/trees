# Trees
A collection of scripts which does the same thing but in different languages: Recursively lists files and directories (visible and hidden) up to a specified depth, and conspiciously lists the directories it cannot read.

Can be useful for enumerating, especially when the native tree function lacks such functionality or the current machine doesn't have tree installed.
